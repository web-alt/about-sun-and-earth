            <h2> SUN </h2>
<br>
            <p>The Sun is a star which is located at the center of our solar system. It is a yellow dwarf star. It gives off energy as light. That includes light, infra-red energy (heat), ultraviolet light and radio waves. It also gives off a stream of particles, which reaches Earth as "solar wind". The source of all this energy is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy.
<br>
The Sun is a star like many others in our Milky Way galaxy. The Sun is a type of star called a G-type main-sequence star based on its spectral class.[15] It has existed for a little over 4.5 billion years. It is going to continue for at least as long. The Sun is about a hundred times as wide as the Earth. It has a mass of 1.9891×1030 kg. This is 333,000 times the mass of the Earth. 1.3 million Earths can fit inside the Sun.[16]
<br>
The Sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second. It can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years for the energy in the core of the Sun to escape.</p>

          <h3> EARTH </h3>
          <br>
          <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago.[28][29] It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
<br>
The large mass of the Sun makes Earth move around it, just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. Earth goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365​1⁄4 times it turns around (one day).
<br>
Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has a large amount of liquid water.[30] About 74% of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this, people sometimes call it the blue planet.[31]
<br>
Because of its water, Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals which require water to survive[32][33] The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of Earth's surface is called the "biosphere".[34]</p>
